into a set of directories ñ one for each chapter. 

Load Programs into an Editor or IDE:

For the benefit of programmers using Ruby In Steel

 solutions into Ruby In Steel For Visual Studio 2008, with the programs 
 for each chapter arranged on the branches of a tree in the Project Manager.

 as it is needed. Users of Ruby In Steel for Visual Studio 2005 may import 
 or convert the projects (via the File New or Open menu).
